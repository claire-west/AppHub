An extensible javascript-based app hub to facilitate a variety of loosely-coupled web apps.

### Features

  - fully asynchronous multilevel requirement loading
- two-way data binding to keep html and model in sync
- shared google sign-on across all apps

### Apps

- a lightweight utility to browse anime from Crunchyroll
- a cloud-based pinboard app using Google sign-on
- a rules reference app for the Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition SRD (and other free resources)

### Misc

### Admin
- an app to manage additional JSON data for use in other apps (like the D&D rules reference)
